# odin-rock-paper-scissors

In this third project following The Odin Project Fundamentals curriculum, I will be using the JavaScript skills I've newly learned to create a simple rock paper scissors game to be played on the console. Later on, I will be adding a GUI (Graphical User Interface) once I acquire the appropriate skills. But for now, I hope to test my knowledge of fundamentals such as variables, functions and for loops with this initial console version. 

Additionally, as a way of improving my approach to coding, I will make be more proactive in adding comments to my source code from this project onwards. It'll be good practice for when I eventually work with teams, as well as be good for myself in better keeping track of my project completion progress. 

Nov. 29 Update:
I have now finished this project and I was quite surprised to see how many skills I ended up getting to practice. Going in, of course I knew I was going to use functions, variables, and for loops. However, as I had only read about for loops prior to starting this assignment, this project turned out to be a great for me to see the practical use for them. In this case, I used a for loop to allow the Rock Paper Scissors game function to loop 5 times.

In addition, the while loops that I similarly read about previously, I found very useful in this project. Here, they were essential in cancelling any player inputs that weren't the three game choices and making the prompt reappear until 'rock', 'paper' or 'scissors' was chosen. 

Lastly, I also got to make practical use of the Math.random function to have the computer make their choice, the increment operator (++) to help keep track of the scores, as well as && (and) and || (or) operators to indicate multiple conditions in an if statement. These all seem to be the fundamentals of JavaScript and I hope to get better at using them going forward. 

Dec. 13 Update:
From this date, I am beginning an update to the Rock Paper Scissors game I created. Previously, I came up with a Rock Paper Scissors game that mainly utilizes the browser console to display the scores and results. Now, with the knowledge I've gained so far, I will modify the game so that it's shown and playable through a GUI (Graphical User Interface) on the page. I'm doing this on a branch of this repo, the first time I've created one. Once the modified version is complete, I will merge the branch with the main one. 

Dec. 16 Update: 
I have completed the GUI update to my Rock Paper Scissors game. Surprisingly, I even did a little review into CSS and Flexbox in trying to organize the layout of the page. I ended up learning a decent number of new things about JavaScript on the way there. Things such as the ability to disable buttons, a function that can be used to refresh the page which was useful for restarting games and situations besides loops where increment/decrement is useful. After this project, I feel more comfortable with how event listeners work and how to add new HTML elements via JavaScript. I look forward to seeing how else I can use those skills in my next projects.
