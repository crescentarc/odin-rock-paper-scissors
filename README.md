# odin-rock-paper-scissors

In this third project following The Odin Project Fundamentals curriculum, I will be using the JavaScript skills I've newly learned to create a simple rock paper scissors game to be played on the console. Later on, I will be adding a GUI (Graphical User Interface) once I acquire the appropriate skills. But for now, I hope to test my knowledge of fundamentals such as variables, functions and for loops with this initial console version. 

Additionally, as a way of improving my approach to coding, I will make be more proactive in adding comments to my source code from this project onwards. It'll be good practice for when I eventually work with teams, as well as be good for myself in better keeping track of my project completion progress.
